# ng-book 2: The Complete Guide to Angular 2 Sample Code

## Organization

Hi! Here's the sample code for the book.

It's organized by `chapter/topic`. Generally, in the book we call out where you can find each code example. 

## Running the code

We're still unifying how each example should be run. Generally, you'll need to `npm install` and then see the `README.md` in each project for instructions to get the example going.
